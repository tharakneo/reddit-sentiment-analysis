"If youre not a VIP to be specifically targeted then you dont have to worry so much. Apple itself didnt really started the automatic install process until December. There are hundreds of millions devices still on the 18 version. (and if needed they can patch older versions with emergency updates)

If I install the .0 version in September without the option to go back then I have to use essentially beta software for weeks and months. Worse battery life, removed features, new bugs and waiting for Apple to decide what they want with the UI. 

There is not a lot of risk to wait until the .4 or .5 version (I did the same last year) after some feedback Apple and app developers fixed the main issues. 

Besides, when there is a new design language and fundamental UX/UI change, its natural some people are waiting with the update. ",2026-01-19,"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1qgqv11/how_long_do_you_go_without_updating_to_the_latest/"

"I used to always update right away but then I remember people talking about various annoying issues with iPadOS 16, so I figured I'd wait until the next update but that one also has reports of issues. And so on and so forth. And then time slipped away and my iPad is still on 15.7 or whatever which is certainly less than ideal because half the time websites use new CSS shit that doesn't work on this ancient version of WebKit but I frankly don't trust that updating between versions so far apart won't break the OS entirely.

I don't rely on it nearly as much as I used to so one of these days I'm probably just gonna hit the update button and hope for the best. I reckon it'll at most be a massive pain in the ass if I end up having to wipe it in case of a botched update.

Biggest issue is that I don't have a Mac, or even know anyone else with a Mac, so in the event that it fucks itself up completely there'll be no easy way to restore it even from recovery mode. And there's not a single Apple store in my city so going there's not an option either.

"In short: 18.7.2 to upcoming 26.3

For earlier versions when Apple did well tested releases, I updated immediately, even major versions. But thats some years ago. Good old times.

Since they started shipping buggy releases, I started to wait for the first point release, e.g., 18.1

Version 26 seems to be new low on release quality. I wait until Apple starts to aggressively push the new release also on slightly older devices (like mine), which they did with 26.2 and then upgrade to the following point release, so upcoming 26.3. My thinking is that 26.2 should give Apple telemetry of a large set of devices so they can fix remaining issues.

I hate Apples move to not provide a 18.7.3 bugfix for 26-capable devices since that leaves me with unfixed vulnerabilities until 26.3 comes out. I decided to take that risk but not a recommendation.",2026-01-19,"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1qgqv11/how_long_do_you_go_without_updating_to_the_latest/"

"Theres a definition distinction I make:  
Update - go to the latest in the current major release youre on  
Upgrade - switch to a newer major release 

_Always_ update nearly immediately.  If your phone is on 26.x you update to 26.2 right now.

For upgrades, its more complex for me. they spend more time on iOS because thats their biggest installed base. I was on 26 pretty early, only not doing the betas because I had a watch that wouldnt take 26, the battery died right when it made sense to get a new one so I did and all to 26. macOS gets less testing im still on 15. Theres nothing in 26 I want, I can wait. I may even just skip 26 and go 27.

"If you open up OBS the thing that streamers use to stream. You can select a bit rate for your stream. The lower your bit rate the more grainy your footage will look the more you move. You can have a super low bit rate if you're sitting still. That's why the different scenes have different bit rates in OBS. Most people have their face cam bitrate lower and their gameplay bitrate high.


It's about how often the pixel needs to update. 


The highest bit rate is about 1 gig a minute. Twitch, YouTube, and Kik automatically select a bit rate based off of your devices internet speed.


Face cams about 50 megs.
Gameplay is usually kept at a gig because it's fast and needs faster updates.

"Microsoft and Google are busy giving attention to the shaft and head respectively, so it's not like apple is unique in that.

A lot of the kowtowing was currying favor to get tariff exemptions, which is *kind of* fair. I hate trump as much as the next true patriot, but I do understand the need for a company that could be destroyed on tariff price increases. At least apple isn't handing out encryption keys to the regime on demand and has a long history of fighting legislation across the globe designed to weaken security for consumer electronics.

The starlink integration is pretty worrying because musk has shown that he absolutely will abuse consumer data and trust, but if you can *actually* turn off the starlink baseband.

Fun fact, but you can never fully turn off the radios that connect to cell towers.

"I bought into ASTs a few years ago.
It's made a lot of money in that time, I've sold what I put in (bought at 7/8 I think) at 70 and now I've just got pure profit.

However at the time I bought into ASTs everyone on the ASTs subreddit were said SpaceX would never work, their tech was crappy etc, that by the time musk had his crappy texting constellation even semi working that we'd all have broadband through ASTs.

But things have changed. 
Starlink direct to cell does work, it's not fast or broadband but it does maps, texting, WhatsApp pretty well now. 

ASTs are years behind where they were meant to be.
The magic ASIC that makes it all possible still isn't in the satellites they're launching/building today, so the ones they've actually launched are all running at ~30% of what they should be.. Some estimate the next ten to go up could be the same. 

I like ASTs, I want it to succeed, but I do have concerns about their ability to deliver, and how much of the market they're losing to SpaceX.

Telefonica originally signed an MoU with ASTs.
Telefonica UK have since signed a contract with spacex to deliver DtC. There are rumours Telefonica Spain have done the same.

The biggest failures of government to allocate capital effectively are a results of the public private partnerships driven by this line of thinking. They almost universally result in bloated contracts that incentivise expanded timeline and constant upwards pricing variations. 

Almost as bad as when public services like electicity, water, health and education get privatised and enshittified because the purpose of the free market is to specifically extract profits, and the idea that profits are aligned with good societal outcomes is patently disproven by decades of increasing wealth gaps accros the world.

Now, if Apple doesn't bring the foldable iPhone with iPadOS, it will be the worst mistake of its life! It doesn't make sense to bring a foldable iPhone with the common iOS, since iPads have a much better separate system, with design and art apps that are not available on iOS, the possibility of opening apps in floating windows, splitting the screen with several apps and so on (which have also existed in the competition for years, but I won't go into that discussion), so bringing an iPhone that opens and becomes a ""tablet"" with a giant screen but without the iPad system is illogical.",2026-02-03,"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1qu9h6v/would_you_guys_prefer_a_passport_style_folding/"

Not every single product thats released has to be made with klutzy slobs in mind. Im not worried about breaking or scratching my screen, I dont scratch at my phone screen like a damn cat. Ive never broken a screen on my iPhone. I dont drop my phone left and right. 



And as for who wants one and whats the point? Plenty of us do. Theres *tons* of use-cases that some of us would have. It would make some parts of my day *sooo* much more convenient to have a foldable phone. I travel for work and Im constantly tweaking my work schedule on my phone, the compressed mobile site version of our portal is so miserable and clunky to use but when expanded on a tablet type screen, it is so much more convenient. A sloppy click or missed opportunity can mean the difference between me spending a weekend in Edinburgh or going to Missoula. seeing our work scheduling app on the girls phone (galaxy fold) next to me on the employee bus, and how much easier and more convenient it was, is what initially got me infatuated with the prospect of owning a fold.


Just earlier tonight, I was on facetime with my friend. I fly for free, shes on my travel-benefits. She was looking to take a trip with me next weekend, so im looking for trips to pick up to work and take her with me, so im on my phone, have her in the corner on facetime, on my work app, looking for trips to pick up,and then switching to my airline app to see which flights have open/available seats for her to ride in. The constant messy shuffling back and forth between apps couldve been soooo much easier and more convenient if I could have opened up a fold, utilized split screen multitasking, and had all of those apps open. Yes, an iPad or laptop couldve mitigated this, but I was in my car at my sisters work parking lot waiting for her to come out so I could give her a ride home. Im not bringing my ipad or laptop with me every time I leave the house, but my phone is surely with me. Theres just no way around it, having a foldable phone in your pocket at all times is so damn convenient and its why so many of us want one. not all of us use our phones to just order doordash and scroll tiktok.",2026-02-03,"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1qu9h6v/would_you_guys_prefer_a_passport_style_folding/"

"And Apple had a Q4 2025 Average Sales Price of $1011 to $1049 depending on whos stats you use vs Samsungs ASP was $249.  So tell me / that shows Apple is selling vast majority of high end Premium flagship level smartphones, their Pro &amp; Pro Max, even Air models outselling and balancing out sales of the 16e, and discounted older models like the iPhone 15 and 16.  Apple iPhones took #1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 of the top 10 selling iPhones.

Samsung is basically selling 4 cheap low midrange A16 and A06 budget phones (#5 &amp; #6 in the top 10 best selling smartphone for all of 2025) to every 1 of its Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra sold, taking a far back #8 in the top 10, just behind the 2 year old iPhone 15 and just ahead of the iPhone 16e.

Unsurprisingly, in just 3.5 months the iPhone 17 Pro Max #4 of the top 10, handily outsold the Galaxy S25 Ultra in its 10 months of sales, and both the A16 and A06 mentioned above.

"We will always have bugs as long as we have updates. Your force of nature is a fair rebuttal to a resignation to bugs, we must exterminate them regularly to prevent infestation, and the exterminators usually come once the bug is found, not preventatively. I worked in a restaurant, we prevented pests, but that seems to be a simpler task than the kind of work that goes on at Apple so the metaphor falls apart.

You know more than me about software development so I'm not going to argue a point I don't understand. Here's my ignorant understanding. A dev makes a feature, that feature interacts with another feature in a way that wasn't tested or produces an unintended behavior. They either fix it or or they ran out of time and planned to fix it in a patch or ignore it.   
  
The kinds of bugs coming from Apple are commonly teams not talking to each other, for example AI and Siri never collaborated and Marketing announced AI features that were never planned for development.   
  
You say that bugs are mistakes, not a force of nature, mistakes made by devs. I argue that the interaction between features in development is hardly tested before launch because teams at Apple doesn't talk to each other. I blame management, not devs. Management wants features to sell to shareholders and customers.

"I feel it's very simple Math. 

There are, right now, over 1 billion active iPhone users, and that number continues to grow every year. 

A larger user base means more people upgrading to the latest iPhone every year. More than enough to offset the longer upgrade cycle. 

The problem isn't that people are holding on to their devices longer. The problem is that Apple evidently can't make enough to meet demand. People don't just want iPhones. They want the best, and are willing to pay for the best. I know the 17 Pro Max was sold out in Singapore for the first couple of months everywhere. In contrast, nobody seemed to want the iPhone Air. That may be why the iPhone 17 comes with only the A19 chip, and still there were shortages everywhere.

"I just learned something new. 

As long as plan to stay with AT&amp;T indefinitely, once you pay the full price for one iPhone, you wont have to pay the price for another iPhone again. 

Lets say you have the iPhone 14 PRO and paid off. You go to AT&amp;T around September and they will give you a credit of $1,100 for that iPhone 14 PRO. You can use that to buy the new iphone 18 coming out. 

Since youve used that credit of $1,100 to purchase the new iPhone 18, you wont be paying that monthly phone price of $30. You will only continue to pay your monthly service plan. 

36 months later you can trade in that iPhone 18 for a credit of 1,100 again (if that sort of offer still stands) and you can get the iPhone 21.",2026-02-10,"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1r0mcpm/upgrading_every_year_is_more_cost_effective_than/"

"On the surface the math is good, but AT&amp;T (and every other post-paid provider) makes their money from the service. So yes, you get a $1,100 phone ""for free"" but you're locked in for 3 years at a much higher rate. I just checked AT&amp;T's site, and it looks like I would have to be on a plan that's \~70/mo to get the promo, meaning that during the entire 3-year period, I would spend $2,520 before taxes + fees.

vs

Buying the phone for $1,100 from Apple directly and paying for 3 years of pre-paid service (like Mint Mobile) which totals closer to $2,180.

"Personally this is what my family does: 

1: wait 2-3 months after launch, then buy phone new from Phone shops (usually theyll sell for 2-300 cheaper or even more)

2. Use phone for 4 years or more 

3. Change to a new Original Apple battery 

4. Use it until it stops getting supported/ too slow/spoilt(whichever comes later)

Usually steps 1-4 is around 6-8 years or even 9 years. Im pretty sure this will save even more than what you mentioned in the post, but one must be willing to use their phone for a very very long time, and not everyone likes using an old phone (currently the oldest daily phone in the house is a iPhone X on its 3rd battery

"I repair iPhones since 2015, had countless other phones in hands and tested them, owned them, probably changed more phones than any of you will change in 10 lifetimes (it's not a flex, it's literally what I did).

Android is cheaper and there are cheaper options, there's no way around it.

iPhones start at 800$ give or take, worldwide, if you want a decent new base model. Who bought SEs back then changed to a new model in a heartbeat, with a few exceptions, I have a client who still uses its SE and when he calls or comes, it's painfully slow and just outdated, obviously.

All this to say, the only way Apple can compete with the Android market (for price) is on the second hand market, and that means getting all the risks of the second hand market. Again I've seen ALL. Insects inside refurbished iPhones, cheap screens that were 2mm above the frame and didn't close properly passed as official and new by stores. You really can't say that market is a good option.

Based on my experience, Android is a better deal.

If we are talking about money for value, iPhone was far worse than it is now, but right now it's still worse than the competition. It just wants to retain that status symbol effect and they don't sell cheap iPhones, so we just don't have new and cheap iPhones, which is  CHOICE and it's not wrong by itself.

All I am saying is that iPhones are not cheap, and the whole argument about making them worth or what's the best way to save money doesn't make a lot of sense here, because you are ALWAYS free to buy whatever you want, and if you want to save money, the iPhone is the mathematical WRONG choice. Again, no way around it. Costs too much.

If you want to save money and make a smart choice, you just buy a mid Android phone for 3-400$ and it does wonders for 3-4 years straight, no subscriptions, a lot more freedom and sometimes even an sd card slot!

Again, if your Apple sheep brain can't comprehend this I will say it again, since I had to deal with this kind of talk every day for a decade, this doesn't mean that the iPhone is bad phone, it's great, it's just not worth the price and when people talk about saving money by buying an iPhone it just sounds silly for who knows even a little bit about phones.

Is this enough? Do you want my receipts or company name to verify?

edit: if you want to go premium I can tell you the iPhone is a solid choice, retains value, works great, still doubtful for iOS 26 which sucks ass but I will give them some time (I think that's planned obsolescence built in, since the OS is heavier and more resource hungry, they can tweak that to make you want to upgrade), while the competition is solid but falls in Apple-wanna-be behaviors and they fail at that, if you lock in Apple you are comfortable, if you lock in Samsung for example, you have all the discomfort of being in an ecosystem but it's FAR less smooth that what Apple provides - as a conclusion, the real reason people want to find cheap iPhones is usually because the iPhone still has that ""cool"" aura and because in the US you need the blue bubble to communicate, it's similar to getting a phone without Whatsapp in the EU if someone else want to understand how it's like, not impossible and still many people use different methods, but yeah iMessage is a big thing",2026-02-10,"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1r0mcpm/upgrading_every_year_is_more_cost_effective_than/"

"You dont buy it from apple. Im not sure if this is only something that applies to Singapore, but in Singapore, you can buy brand new devices from non apple phone stores outside.

2. The guy doesnt want the phone, didnt open it

3. For easy selling they sell it to the phone shop, who offers $800 for it (example)

4. Shop sells phone for $1k

"That's fine, I guess? Seems a bit of an arbitrary system. Although certainly better value than buying brand new every year (but that's a low bar).

You're still buying a 'new' iPhone every year, and having to go through refurbished markets at that. Sounds expensive and a hassle. Refurbs can be...quirky. And you always have a 1-2 year old iPhone.

A flaw in your system is that doesn't take into account that Apple's upgrades and value proposition isn't linear year on year. For example: a refurb 16 Pro is \~£650 here. Unless you \*really\* need that third lens, a brand new £799 17 is better value. Other years a refurb is better value. I just buy new or used (whatever seems best value at the time) when I feel it's worth the upgrade.

Perhaps your system is more favourable if you want Pro Max models and extra storage, tbf.",2026-02-10,"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1r0mcpm/upgrading_every_year_is_more_cost_effective_than/"

I went from a 3G to a 6 and then a 6 to an 11. At this point Im probably looking at an 18 or 19 as my next phone. And even now Im considering something pre-owned, maybe a year or two old.

I love my iPhone, but the prices of new phones have gone crazy and the innovation and diminishing returns in terms of features and benefits just isnt there anymore. I dont need a phone as thin as three sheets of paper, I dont need a screen the size of my TV, and I dont need a 12 week battery life or whatever other benchmark they are using to justify the lack of innovation and slow but steady year-on-year price hikes.

"Funnily enough, the guy that was first trying to synthesize it first wanted to call it alumium but in a later notes entry called it aluminum. Other scientists wanted to keep the tradition ium suffix for metals. 

In a publication made in 1808, he stated that, had he been successful in isolating the metallic substance he was after, he would have proposed the name Alumium for this elusive element. Apparently unconvinced by this first name, he used the word Aluminum in a book published four years later when mentioning that &Aluminum has not been obtained in a perfectly free state.
Nevertheless, other British chemists decided to adopt the name Aluminium. They thought it had a more classical sound and was in line with the ending of the other elements isolated by Davy. This confusion began the debate on the ending of the word that continues to our day.


The reason Americans spell it aluminum is because the creator of Websters dictionary omitted aluminium spelling completely and favored the aluminum spelling.

&in the early 1900s as the metal became a more widely available product. More and more people were finding themselves in the situation of having to spell the name of this element properly. 
Most people likely relied on the Websters Dictionary, published in 1828, for this spelling. Noah Webster, the dictionarys editor, favored the -um spelling so much that he omitted the -ium ending from his work altogether.

But I got it and lo and behold, it was a 512 GB AND I was able to get AT&amp;T to unlock it immediately for me. So it was a huge win for me. AppleCare+ has been nothing short of wonderful for me. I've used it multiple times for my Apple Watches, my wife's, and two of my iPhones now.",2026-02-10,"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1r0r4tj/applecare_replaced_my_17_pm_256gb_to_a_17pm_2tb/"
"Wait so if you get a replacement through Apple+ does it come carrier unlocked if your original phone was still locked or no?",2026-02-12,"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1r0r4tj/applecare_replaced_my_17_pm_256gb_to_a_17pm_2tb/"
"So heres the deal. Ive heard conflicting info about this. The moment I got the shipment email from Apple, I ran the IMEI through AT&amp;Ts unlock portal and it worked.

From what Ive read, though, the replacement phone is supposed to carry over the same SIM lock status as the original device. So maybe I just got lucky? Or maybe because I submitted the unlock request immediately after shipment, AT&amp;T hadnt synced the IMEI change with Apple yet? But I did this before I even had the device in hand from FedEx.

Im not exactly eager for them to close whatever loophole this was, since it worked out pretty nicely. And honestly, the whole US carrier locking system is ridiculous. Im still paying AT&amp;T for the original device even though my AppleCare replacement has a different IMEI. If I left AT&amp;T tomorrow, Id still owe the remaining device balance either way, so I dont really see the harm in the phone being unlocked.",2026-02-12,"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1r0r4tj/applecare_replaced_my_17_pm_256gb_to_a_17pm_2tb/"

Then he frowned, looking at his iPad. Apparently they didn't actually have an X. He went and got manager approval to replace my X with a XS, which they actually did have in stock.

"Spotify is a small company. They are not owned by any other company, and their global workforce is in the single digit thousands (~7500 employees), and that is only because of the post pandemic hiring explosion. Before 2020, Spotify had less than 4500 employees across the globe. They also do not invest in their UI *anymore*. They spent a ton of capital to develop the UX early on across multiple platforms, but they dont need the entire teams after the products are built. The Spotify iOS app has remained largely the same since 2015 with only slight branding tweaks. It is functionally the same app. Web-based Spotify is also fundamentally the same but received a UI uplift to match the mobile version design. Do you remember how long it took Spotify to ship basic features like lyrics? And dont forget their doomed Hi-Fi tier that took many years longer to release than they intended. Spotify is a small company and it shows. They dont make a lot of money, most of it is eaten up by the big fish music labels and Spotify has to split their returns with independent artists.

"I work in a huge corporation, whose services include an app that millions of people use. A few months ago I sat in on a marketing meeting which covered the iOS 26 update. 

We were taken through some research which indicated overwhelmingly negative sentiment towards ""liquid glass"". Apple had automatically updated our app icon, and the entire room agreed it looked ""blurry and terrible"", and damaged our brand. 

We looked at some of the ways our competitors had responded to liquid glass, and concluded that our next update would fix our icon back to how it was before, and that we wouldn't be involving liquid glass in our UX design going forward. 

The marketing folks also HATED what the different app icon colour options did to our icon, so there was a whole discussion on how to make that look ""as less ugly as possible"".",2026-01-31,"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1qrd1xn/spotify_removed_liquid_glass_from_their_icon/"

"Exactly. Spotify's recent decision to drop support for Liquid Glass (Apple's new visual aesthetic in iOS 26) is perceived as a form of strategic resistance.

The technical and political reasons behind this are:
Independent Identity: Daniel Ek argues that Spotify should have its own unified design system across all platforms. Adopting Liquid Glass means ceding visual control to Apple's APIs, something Spotify avoids in order not to be ""just another iOS app.""
Usability Issues: Developers have reported that the liquid glass effect can cause blurry icons and difficult-to-read controls, which clashes with Spotify's priority of maintaining a clear, high-contrast interface.
Avoiding Apple's ""Trap"": Apple allows developers to disable Liquid Glass through a code tweak, but it is expected to become mandatory in the future. By rejecting it now, Spotify is making its position clear before Apple forces them to jump through its new aesthetic hoops.

Prioritizing its own features: Instead of investing resources in adapting the app to iOS's visual whims, Spotify has focused on features that directly compete with Apple's ecosystem, such as its new real-time group chats launched in February 2026. In short, while Apple tries to make all apps look ""liquid,"" Spotify prefers to remain green and dark, maintaining its distance from any standard that gives its biggest rival more control.

"Its not necessarily the texting that people enjoy with Spotifys social features, rather the collaborative playlists. There are Jams which are live sessions where everyone scans a QR code and you can all add your own songs to a playlist and adjust the queue order, skip and pause and whatnot individually from everyones device. Then there are Blends which is a playlist two or more people can create together and it will refresh daily and give you songs that both of you enjoy based off your shared taste and listening habits. If Apple Music has these features that would be really cool, I am not aware, but I mostly just wanted to let you know their social features are more useful than just texting which you can do on any other platform. :)",2026-02-03,"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1qrd1xn/spotify_removed_liquid_glass_from_their_icon/"

"The iOS app icon has been updated to be just like the Spotify app icon on other platforms.

On iOS 26 the standard Liquid Glass effect used to be applied which dimmed the green color and made the background more grey, but now the effect is no longer being applied to the updated icon. Green logo is the correct color and the background is back to being black instead of grey now.

"Exactly. Spotify's recent decision to drop support for Liquid Glass (Apple's new visual aesthetic in iOS 26) is perceived as a form of strategic resistance.

The technical and political reasons behind this are:
Independent Identity: Daniel Ek argues that Spotify should have its own unified design system across all platforms. Adopting Liquid Glass means ceding visual control to Apple's APIs, something Spotify avoids in order not to be ""just another iOS app.""
Usability Issues: Developers have reported that the liquid glass effect can cause blurry icons and difficult-to-read controls, which clashes with Spotify's priority of maintaining a clear, high-contrast interface.
Avoiding Apple's ""Trap"": Apple allows developers to disable Liquid Glass through a code tweak, but it is expected to become mandatory in the future. By rejecting it now, Spotify is making its position clear before Apple forces them to jump through its new aesthetic hoops.

Prioritizing its own features: Instead of investing resources in adapting the app to iOS's visual whims, Spotify has focused on features that directly compete with Apple's ecosystem, such as its new real-time group chats launched in February 2026. In short, while Apple tries to make all apps look ""liquid,"" Spotify prefers to remain green and dark, maintaining its distance from any standard that gives its biggest rival more control.
Do you prefer Spotify to adapt to your iPhone's design, or do you like it to maintain its unique look even if it doesn't match the rest of the system?",2026-02-01,"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1qrd1xn/spotify_removed_liquid_glass_from_their_icon/"

"Thats a good point, no not at all really. The optical is basically a camera taking a 2d pic of the valleys and ridges.. so kinda secure. Cant use a sheet of paper to bypass. 

But the ultrasonic stuff its actually built into the display panel itself and super thin and uses an almost radar/sonar type pulse to get a highly detailed read.. and its almost instant. But a piece of dust can mess it up. Way secure though. Also a lot more expensive if you break screens. 

Its all a balance.. overall though the ultrasonic is better bet. Most people have clean hands and just buy a special screen protector made for them and its all good.",2026-02-04,"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1quz23v/new_iphone_fold_specs_revealed_including_design/"

"Looks to be necessary in order to achieve the device, which is understandable from a components and physics perspective, and terrible from a user perspective. Face ID is a staple of iPhone, and a really high quality feature. Side Button Touch ID, like on iPad Air, is quite possibly the worst user experience Apple currently ships in a hardware product. And this is what they tapped for their $2,000 Ultra iPhone.

"100% agree. Hoping an engineer at Apple realizes this, but its probably too late. Would think these have already entered into production for release in September.

"I can't see Apple adding 2 Face ID modules, even if they were thin enough to fit into the chassis they're building for this thing. But...presumably it will have 2 cutouts for selfie cameras? Or will the unfolded view have no front facing camera?

"Funny, I found Touch ID to be one of the best features Apple has ever shipped in their devices. I love it on all my Apple devices, including the iPad Air. Face ID has always been unreliable for me, whereas Touch ID ""just works"" every time. There's no mental load attached to it because you just click the button to get to the homescreen whereas with Face ID there's a time window where it scans your face and if you don't happen to look at a right angle, you have to type your passcode. Switching to an iPhone with Face ID has been the most significant UX dowgrade for me when using Apple devices because I have to type my passcode something like 1/5 times.

For my use case though it would only benefit me if the iPad also had a data plan.

With a foldable phone I can have both in one device without paying for another line.

Once it launches I will crunch the numbers to see if it is financially feasible to either get the fold or an iPad mini with a data plan.

I was a diehard Apple hater for a while because they were always so behind but have them a try when I needed a fitness watch and got sucked into the walled garden.

"Agreed - i moved to the OnePlus Watch 3 with the phone i got (Oppo and OnePlus are same company).  Its pretty comparable to Apple Watch TBH.  I don't find myself unable to do anything with it that I could do with the Apple Watch. Luckily I kept my Apple Watch and still use an iPad Mini + whole family uses Apple so it'll for sure be much less jarring for me stepping back into Apple's walled garden vs. when I left it.  It would be nice if they were forced to open up more, but I doubt it'll happen - they have unlimited money for lawyers to fight all that.   Really hoping the fold does what so many products of theirs have done before - wait until the tech is mature and then release a mostly mature version of the thing from the start.  I still think Oppo will be ahead on their silicon carbon battery that charges insanely quickly and seems to last forever.  Also lets the phone be thinner - basically iPhone Pro when folded and crazy thin when open.

"Well based on your analogy to counter my statement, this is subject to practicality.

Practically speaking, we all need and use a phone daily. Same can be said for a car to an extent although truth be told, I live in a city with great public transportation and dont own a car.

Im not saying everyone would feel the same about the fold because clearly some people will want it for a multitude of reasons. Driving an 18wheeler is very much removed from calling it a daily driver to contrast my opinion. Absolutely no one outside of a person whose literal job is to drive an 18 wheeler will do so or maybe a child who thinks big trucks are cool.

Seeing the downvotes on my first comment is kinda why people who dont like Apple stay not liking it. God forbid someone has an opinion about a feature of an upcoming product that they dont see purpose or value in.

"Ok replace 18 wheeler with truck or a vehicle with 4x4. Its a more niche vehicle that does what a car can do but you get extra space. 

If you then also care about practicality you can get an entry level phone. Do you happen to have a pro model of your iPhone? Some people probably made your same argument about the wide angle lens and just stick with the non-pro models.

I think its weird people just assume there would NEVER be other options and cant just let a product exist without having to comment that it is t for them and dont understand why anyone wants one.

"1. I read it and still dont see anything about the alleged requirement for placing Apple apps next to 3rd party apps in an ABC list. As far as I know the EU DMA is mainly about the ability to change the default apps and services, interoperability etc not about UI. [Apple DMA regulations](https://ec.europa.eu/competition/digital_markets_act/cases/202344/DMA_100025_228.pdf)

2. Why is Siri, Wallet&amp;Apple Pay and iCloud still on the main page? Isnt that allegedly unfair promotion favouring their own services?

3. It looks like Google Android is a [gatekeeper](https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/gatekeepers_en) as well, so does that mean the Android Camera, Phone, Messages etc. app settings are also lumped together with 3rd party apps in a buried list?

4. How come Apple is whining a lot about the EU requirements like browser engine, app store, mirroring, how the law hurts the user experience in their opinion etc. but they never complained about how they are allegedly forced to change the Settings UI? Why is this worldwide and not just EU?

The sad thing is that losing it didnt benefit anyone. Apple took 3D Touch away, iPhone prices havent come down, and battery life isnt significantly different than it was before. It was a sub-1mm layer in the display that provided a host of unique functionality and convenient shortcuts, well worth whatever minute cost difference and a few extra minutes of battery power.",2026-01-18,"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1qgbvcz/whats_one_small_ios_change_you_still_havent/"

"No longer being able to control *all* my HomeKit devices from within control center.

This was like 2 or 3 versions back now, but you used to be able to tap the HomeKit control center icon and open an overlay with all your rooms and devices, making quick changes sooo easy.

Nowadays, tapping that icon just opens the home app. Kinda the same thing, but way more annoying. Takes longer to animate all the app switching and obviously kicks you out of your current app.

And adding all the individual devices to control center directly is *not* a replacement. For one thing, I don't have space for all of them (and multiple CC pages suck too, since they make closing CC more annoying), but more importantly you have to manage all these pages when you add/remove devices or change their layout in the home app.

"Checkmark in colored circle  means ... everything and anything. The colors vary based on the accent color of the app, but the color itself has no meaning.

The button means done, close, save, exit, next, and committed - off the top of my head. It has no place in Notes, which autosaves. (All the ""Done"" button ever did in Notes was ""close the keyboard"", to make scrolling safer - less likely to make errant keystrokes - and give you a larger reading surface. It's a myth that you needed to tap ""Done"" to save the Note, and the checkmark further falsely emphasizes that. This is easily demonstrated when using Notes in iCloud, where you can see all devices update within a moment of pausing typing.)

The colored checkmark is supposed to make things easier for users but it just makes everything mean anything, completely obscuring the specific action it will perform.

It's also hard to document. In the past, you could say tap "" Done"", but now you either have to embed an actual icon  and you don't even know what color to make it since the color can vary depending upon a user's color scheme  or you have to call it ""the checkmark in the colored circle.""

"There was a rather famous incident on reddit about 10 years ago, where a guy claimed someone was leaving weird Post-it"" notes all over his house that he didn't remember writing, and also that he had headaches.  

Another redditor came along in the comments and suggested he get a carbon monoxide detector.  

As soon as he plugged it in. it started alarming immediately.  He thought it was broken, but he plugged in a second one and sure enough, he got confirmation that the air was indeed very toxic.  

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/34l7vo/ma_postit_notes_left_in_apartment/

This story went mega-viral and the guy ended up being interviewed about it for a radio program on NPR, IIRC.  

He lived in an old house in Massachusetts.  Older homes tended to be poorly ventilated and poorly insulated, requiring additional use of fire to heat the home, hence the carbon monoxide buildup.  It also supported speculation that older homes tended to be thought of as ""haunted"" because their owners were simply hallucinating ghosts due to CO buildup.",2026-02-08,"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1qz2pst/random_written_notes_showing_up_in_my_icloud/"

It would have been a lot easier to text either emergency services or someone that could have given us directions to where we needed to go, over text.

"This is the main reason I badly regret switching to the fold 7. Not even a month after getting it, we were traveling and came upon an accident, where the car was upside down and a senior was pinned under the seat, while her daughter and son in law managed to get free. It was winter in the Yukon, and much of our highway has no service for literal hours between stops.

Could this fold 7 connect to its SOS feature to call for help? NO! No matter what we tried neither my or my husbands android phones had worked. Thankfully the SIL had an iPhone, but he had no idea how to use satellite messaging. His iPhone had activated crash detection as well, but again, he didn't know how to use it. I did, so I had him unlock the phone, and it immediately connected, I contacted 911, texted them everything that happened, and they dispatched help. Meanwhile, we did everything to keep her warm and comfortable. I kept on the text until police arrived nearly 30 min later, followed by fire and ambulance.

The senior had sustained some broken bones, a concussion, and some other minor injuries, but she's since made a full recovery. The couple was unharmed. 

I was, and still am, absolutely *furious* about how badly both androids failed. If the SIL didn't have an iPhone, it could have been so much longer to dispatch help. We're so lucky the seniors injuries weren't more severe. Satellite messaging is an incredible feature on the iPhone I used constantly with my 15 pro max. I didn't even think about it. We went out of cell range a lot.  And Android failed when I needed it. If I wasn't trapped in a contract I'd throw this phone back at my carrier.

The T-Mobile option works with a lot of different phone brands including iPhone. But like you said, it's $10/mo. OTOH, with the T-mobile option you also get stuff like WhatsApp and Twitter support.

No, this isn't another ""why does autocorrect suck so much now?"" type response. 

**It's always sucked.**

The second the very first device (ANY device) changes what I type, I immediately look to turn autocorrect off.

iPhone has always had autocorrect and I've kept it off since getting my first iPhone in 2009. 

I type service tags, serial numbers, mac addresses, passcodes, programming terms and variable names, etc. Autocorrect tries to ""fix"" those.

"Just one?  I read replies to questions like yours just so I can learn about the ones that might be useful that Ive been ignorant about up to now.

I love my iPhone, and Im definitely a tech nerd, but its constant work just to keep up with technological evolution relating to my main pursuits (composing and producing music).  While, I still love learning useful new features and I am in need of facilities that are better than ones in using in certain cases, ive lost interest in spending time trying to get every little feature out of my phone.

I actually spend time avoiding updates so that they wont mess with my workflow. That applies more than my Mac than my phone, or at least it hasnt passed until now. now though, Im avoiding the upgrade to iOS 26 and my phone has started to pester me about that regularly. I dont like the idea that its going to reduce battery life, and I dont want things to just change on me and require me to spend time dealing with things and learning new aspects, right when Im in the middle of working on something. Thats one of the reasons I dislike windows, because it Microsoft would enforce changes and require me to spend time re-learning how to do things I had already baked into my habits for years. I think that Steve Jobs wouldnt want his users to experience that, but theres been less of his  user experience comes first focus since he passed (I guess I shouldve meant that, that viewpoint probably drives Apples reason for making changes, I just dont think there is successful with supporting continuity to prior system versions, for example, although I never got into using the launchpad, people seem to be upset that its missing from Tahoe). And that Tim Cook is about to retire ( although hell probably stay connected), I think theres probably going to be more of this enforced relearning how to use some aspects of my device in my future.

All that said, I like to read questions like this one because thats often where I will learn about new features. I hadnt heard about freeform until just now, and that looks like it could be quite useful. I use Notes daily, sometimes hourly.

As to back tapping, Im an older fart note, and my eyesight isnt as good as it was, so the magnifier feature is very handy, and I have assigned that to my back tap. Yes, it turns on sometimes when I dont need it, but its so easy to turn it off again that I dont mind that much.",2026-01-22,"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1qjqabb/whats_one_iphone_feature_apple_added_that_you/"

On the surface, it seems like a simple little pachinko game (like Peggle back in the day), but theres a LOT of strategy going on under the hood, to build a good hand of weapons and power-ups for the enemies youre dealt. 

At first, the game seems short, but theres a variety of characters with different starting abilities, and the difficulty is a slow burn that builds and builds over time for maximum replayability. 

First board is free to try so you can see if its your jam, and then a one-time purchase. Zero micro transactions. Developer is active and drops new content from time to time.

"As a technologist, IMO, Gboard (Google's 3rd party keyboard/app), is far superior, allows for better swipe texting, and allows for better  auto correct and predictive text suggestions. Just don't provide Full Access to the app so it doesn't read your every keyboard input. 

As a bonus, Gboard also has an extensive kaomoji keyboard!

"""Go to show"" does the same thing as clicking on the icon of the podcast. Simply finding anything in your library takes 3-4 actions.

I want to be able to sort episodes for a podcast when viewing all episodes. There is sorting on the show page but the not ""See All"" page. You can go back to the show page, sort oldest to newest then go back to the ""See All"" page. The sort is in the ""Episodes"" sub menu so you have to go into that, then into the sort order.

When you open a show page on spotify, you have a search box at the top, that only searches that show's episodes. It shows you all episodes of the show without having to go to another page and allows you to sort episodes right there and then.

"A lot of people are pushing back on OP by listing new features that Apple Podcasts has added, but that misses the point.

Apple Podcasts sucks for the same reason that Apple Music, iOS, watchOS, macOS, and just about every other piece of software in the Apple ecosystem have gone downhill over the past decade - today's Apple is a marketing company, not a design company.

Apple used to be a design company. It used to build products so that **A)** ""It just works"" and **B)** it is simple, intuitive, and logical. The Alan Dye era changed all of that. Alan Dye sucks at functional design. He knows how to make things aesthetically beautiful, but the actual information architecture, affordances, and layout of apps - is just bad in the Dye era.

Combine that with the fact that there's no Steve Jobs figure at the very top who lays out a clear path for all software design - and you get a company that makes overly complex, unintuitive pieces of software that overwhelm you with features that often don't even work properly.

  
Thankfully, Alan Dye is notwgone. His replacement (Steve Lemay) is allegedly an excellent designer, so hopefully things will improve over the next few years. I don't think we'll ever see Apple return to the straight forward simplicity of the Steve Jobs era, but I'm optimistic that things can get a lot better than they currently are.",2026-02-07,"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1qxkjxf/why_does_apple_simply_refuse_to_improve_the/"

Cool. Continue to use it. Apple has never claimed to have the best app; its just their version produced in-house.

&gt; The biggest reason is how easily it handles automatic downloads of new episodes and syncing across multiple devices, something Apple Podcasts still struggles with. 

I have never had this issue and used to listen to podcasts across 3 devices. Only stopped because my main podcast is video based and I got tired of not seeing when they held something up or referenced something on a screen.

&gt; I run everyday and prefer to leave my phone at home, so I listen to podcasts on my watch instead. With Overcast, I just tap Sync before my run and the latest episodes are downloaded and ready to go. 

Does the Apple Watch even support the podcasts app? I dont recall seeing it, and but it should sync just fine.

And if it doesnt, is it really so hard to glance at your phone, see that the podcast is 32 min in and then scroll forward until its in the right spot on the watch?

While Im sure its convenient to them, this isnt Apples fault and Im surprised how often its brought up. The reason why Apple (and other manufacturers) are dropping their cables is because of the same law that made Apple go to USB-C. A law in the EU targeting e-waste is making mobile devices go USB-C and also imposing unbundling which is no longer selling a USB-C with every product.

It may feel bad *now* in the interim, but this works in the long run as far as targeting e-waste. Give it a year or two and everyone will have enough USB-C cables its not necessary to be given a new one with each sale.

"A very gulliable take.

Iphone prices have stayed relatively the same ever since the brick removal.

Taking away the brick increases net gain on each sold unit by a few dozen dollars, include the smaller packaging reducing shipping fee's and you're already sitting on a few thousand free dollars per shipping container. 

Now back when they removed the brick the price did not drop. Adjust that gain by 6 years and you've got a reason as to why apple could easily afford to not increase the iphone's price for that long.

Even if you were to remove all chargers from every device sold from now on you'd have negligable impact on e-waste or waste in general considering the fact that western world (arguably the efforts did improve the status quo) produces dramatically small amounts of waste compared to some other regions which are less inclined towards mitigating their impact on the world.

Also the reason apple did not change to USB-C earlier on iphones was primarily profit. Nearly everyone who owns a mac owns an iphone, same goes for watches and airpods. Forcing consumers to ideally buy two cables from the same company or two bricks for the matter also increases profits. Ooooor they can buy their ""magic magsafe charger""

The EU law simply put an end to that. There's a reason why there was such a push against third party chargers possibly damaging devices. Its all a hoax meant to coerce the average customer into buying a branded charging accessory. 

Anyways.

Personally i'd love to see a wireless phone, supposedly one EU spokesperson did say that a phone without a cable would be compliant under EU law in relation to the iphone air. I'd love to have the air entirely remove the lower charging/speaker assembly, shift the battery lower possibly allowing for a second camera. Iphone Air is way too gone for any sense of rugged workload (whatever that is supposed to be, just get a proper camera) so i personally would settle for a wireless phone simply as a matter of convenience.

"This bit me in the ass last year when I got in a car accident. The other driver showed me their insurance ID card. I had just gotten my new phone a few months prior and I'm not a big camera person, but I used it to take a picture of their insurance ID card. In the viewfinder, I verified the text was readable so I hit the shutter button and put my phone in my pocket not thinking anything of it (I was on the side of the road and wanted to get out of there). Told the other driver I'll file the claim since they were at fault and I had a dent in my fender (their car was a jeep and I drive a little sedan so it was their wheel that hit me, they had no damage). 

Anyways I get home and the picture of the insurance ID card on my phone was an unreadable jumbled up mess.

But i think since the 15 pro iphone cams sometimes produce not evenly sharp pictures especially close up.. due to the lens probably.

I think it was with the main lens eg photographing text close, right before the iPhone would switch to the ultra wide lens.

"My point is that the same story has happened again. Just like with the iPhone 6, Apple tried experimenting making a phone as thin as possible. They didnt test the device enough and threw it to the market anyways.

The iPhone 17 Pro line isnt just experimenting with a new product, they wanted to dissipate the heat of the processor. Instead of making some sort of heat dissipation solution like the vapor chamber mod some guys did for the iPhone 15 or any other alternative, they made the entire device in aluminum for said purpose.

Its a lazy solution and pretty disappointing. The phone itself is fine, using aluminum is not bad as is, but its a way cheaper and way less durable metal. The casting process is more prone to having weak spots, the reason why some people are receiving their device with scratches, dents and some, after merely weeks of use, their phone breaks on the weak spot of the antenna.

This is a win win for apple as the product is way more profitable this way, and the newer design makes the older devices different enough to look like the older model (for fomo)

Again, the iPhone 17 pro is not a bad product, the company greed behind it is. Its also the reason why these posts exist, its too much money for so many defects. Titanium and stainless steel didnt have any defects thanks to the durability and resistance of the material and its production process

"What different universe?

Here in my country its mandatory for shops to open your phone and turn it on so the store employee and the buyer can see its working, then its turned off and sealed again, you go to the cashier pay and leave.

They put stamp into the warranty card and the stamp says ""TESTED AT THE SHOP""

If you have that stamp and pay, there is no returning it back because you saw it working and were tested before you paid.

The moment you pay the only way to return it for defect is actually returning it for service where they change the damaged parts.

No one will accept opened phone back and give you a new one because you did not see some defect while doing the in-store unboxing test. 

I always inspect the phones before they put the stamp on the warranty card.

I look for dents, scratches, micro scratches on the screen, dust in the cameras, dust in the port and speakers, i always make sure to fast setup the phone so i can see if screen, camera, microphones and speakers are working properly.

If you find issues on the test unboxing, they go back and get a new unit and the whole test starts again.",2026-02-05,"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1qwdcn9/brand_new_iphone_17_pro_max_with_dent_out_of_box/"

To remove app time limits on an iPhone, navigate to Settings &gt; Screen Time &gt; App Limits, where you can delete existing limits or disable App Limits entirely by turning off the top toggle.

If your parents set the limits then you need the parental lock passcode or your parents apple ID and password to reset the code and you're out of luck. Don't try to steal this info and ruin their trust. Not worth it, they will find out with an alert on their phone/account. 

Talk to your parents but the fact you are hesitant tells me you already know the answer. It's not the worst thing in the world to stay off social media. Use the time for something more constructive.

"If this is iOS 26.2, then yes there is a real, new problem and everyone can help by reporting to Apple!



Starting with iOS 26.2, there's a new bug affecting Apple Screen Time. On your device's first pickup, all app limits might activate prematurely, even if you haven't used any apps or websites. This issue occurs sporadically and unpredictably.

## How To Fix (If You Use Apple Screen Time)

There's no permanent solution until Apple resolves this issue. For now, you can apply these temporary fixes:

- **Option 1:** Disable App Limits, wait about 3 seconds, then re-enable them
- **Option 2:** Restart your device
- **Option 3:** Delete your existing App Limit settings, then recreate them exactly as before

These methods ""reset"" Screen Time, forcing it to recalculate your limits. You will need to repeat these steps if the issue recurs on subsequent days.

## How to Fix (If You Use a Third-Party App)

Third-party apps are also impacted since they rely on Apple's Screen Time technology. Hopefully your app has some ""reset blocking"" button somewhere in it's settings.

## How You Can Help

If you're an Apple beta tester or developer, submit feedback via feedbackassistant.apple.com under Developer Technologies &amp; SDKs &gt; iOS &gt; Device Activity Framework &gt; Events. Reference the feedback number: FB21267341.

Alternatively, you can contact Apple Support and mention feedback number FB21267341.

_(P.S. the ""feedback number"" is an Apple Bug Report that Refocus filed before iOS 26.2 was even released, and it contains a LOT of data about this problem which will hopefully help fix this issue faster)_",2026-01-23,"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1qiwjne/i_need_help_with_screen_time/"

"Your parents are there for a reason. Theres a lot of creepy people online and they want nothing aside from your protection. The screen time is stating that there actually is an issue with how long you take on the phone. As an adult, I still play games, and I still watch reels or TT, however I only spend maybe 2-3 hours at most a day on my phone altogether. Its not anyone controlling you, its people saying that theres more to life than a little box you hold in your hand. Instead of going to your main hobbies, pick something else up. If you dont want to read, build something& be a kid fr, because once youre our age, theres no going back and youll hate it. Also give some love to your parents& because one day such as my own, they wont be here anymore& and trust me, the regret youll have will tear you down.

Even in a brand new iphone those seals are just to RESIST water and not completely waterproof, if you wanna clean it, use a microfiber towel with just a bit of isopropyl alcohol and that should do the work.

I personally just brush em with a used toothbrush then spray 70% isopropyl alcohol on a microfiber cloth and wipe em clean, wet side then dry side of the microfiber cloth.

The IP rating is there for peace of mind only. The company will tell you that its okay to wash it so when it breaks, youll buy their product again.

So, people who carrier-finance are paying way more than they need to, although nominally that cost is associated with the plan and not the physical device.

Also, these carrier plans nudge people to replace a perfectly good iPhone every year or two years, which is far more often than people need - which also has a cost.

"When your perfectly good iPhone 16 from last year is still working, you dont need Apples latest flagship. As long as a device meets your needs, nothing more is necessary, meaning that you shouldnt be dropping $1k+ a year just because you *want* the latest and greatest. If you cant afford it without financing, then you cant afford it at all. I needed a laptop for college last year, and I had been saving money, not for a laptop, just saving. I say that I *needed* one, because my desktop at home is older than I am and slower than anything you can imagine, so short deadlines would have been a death sentence, plus borrowing a laptop/tablet from my college library isnt the most practical, nor would it always be an option, as other students may be using them. I was able to buy a brand new M4 MacBook Air (purchased by choice, not by limitation of budget.

"No one said anyone needed anything, I specifically said want. And if youre fine being miserable with a slow piece of tech, I love that for you, but that doesnt mean people shouldnt get the things they want. Functionality depends on what you consider functional. A windows 7 computer is functional and works, I have a few, doesnt mean you dont get a new laptop thats more efficient. Clearly you just dont like or dont trust yourself when it comes to financing because the whole point of it is you dont pay it all up front so you get the benefit of the thing you want (and with places like Apple you pay in installments with no interest), instead of saving and forgoing the use of the item.  If theres zero % interest and small equal payments theres no reason not to get access to the thing youre planning to buy anyway, earlier. Saying you cant afford to buy something because you finance it is the most fiscally ignorant thing Ive ever heard. You think rich people buy things with their own money? No. They finance it, Disney financed Disney Land, Trump financed his failed businesses, Elon financed buying Twitter and consumers just do it on a smaller scale, but thinking you have to pay upfront for something is how people that dont understand money think. Do you think people that want to go to college but dont need to go to college save and pay up front? They get a loan or a grant. Do you think people do that for cars? Thats what car loans are for.  Houses? Who is buying houses with saved cash? Thats why people have mortgages. People have functioning cars, doesnt mean you save up to buy a new one when you can finance it. Same goes for houses. And those have 6-13% interest from the start so, youre objectively wrong when it comes to whats considered affordability.

"i never said anything about not backing up somewhere else. There are plenty of little tools that allow for a simple one click sync/backup to any offline media of your choice. Let's say an external hard disk. Under your control, not locked behind vague terms and services, no risk of loosing access for any reason, screwing up something on your 2FA.

I have my photo library of the last 10-15 years copied 3+ times, takes no effort at all, for a price that is a fraction of the cloud, and with storage options that are practically limitless for the purpose.

That's a proper backup. Cloud is for syncing and convenience. With clouds there's not a single guarantee for average consumers. Something goes wrong, you're screwed. No redundancy, no guaranteed uptime, no guaranteed recoveries. What you see is what you get and zero service. 

Imagine you want to switch ecosystems, or restore a system, with those lousy bottlenecked data speeds on the server side. It's a complete pain in the ass, but that's how they want it, because that way you'll never think of abandoning the juicy revenue stream that is cloud storage.

I have an iPhone and I am an apple ecosystem fan. iCloud is on of the best features apple gives. I don't know why people not just keep their data in iCloud. Privacy? iCloud is very safe with privacy (until we learn that it's not), but there is a mode called ""Advanced Data Protection"" that YOU and ONLY YOU can see your data. Not even apple. Your data will be END-TO-END encrypted and you will have the key. That's what i use but the only problem is that if you lose the key, then not even apple could retrieve your data.. so keep that in mind.

There is zero hardware restriction that limits apples ability to update certs. They arent processor heavy at all. The reason Apple doesnt keep older devices usable is simply because of capitalistic greed.

"I have another solution:

** ** 
** **   

Create **Shortcut 1** that does the following:  

1. Set **Ringtone Volume** to **100%**  
2. Start a **Timer** for **0 seconds**  

** **   
** **   

Create another **Shortcut 2** that does the following:  

1. Wait 20 seconds  
2. Set **Ringtone Volume** to **50%**  

** **   
** **   

Create an **Automation** to run Shortcut 1 immediately without confirmation when any alarm goes off.  

Create an **Automation** to run Shortcut 2 immediately without confirmation when any alarm is stopped.  

** **   
** **   

This will make every alarm go off at 100% volume and then return the ringtone volume to 50% or whatever you like to keep it at. You need the Timer action because for some reason changing the ringtone volume won't change the volume of an alarm that has already gone off.

"Yup. In the US, theres a very different demand curve for subscriptions and in-app purchases for iPhone and Android users. 

The average salary of iPhone users is around [43% higher](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iphone-users-spend-101-every-month-on-tech-purchases-nearly-double-of-android-users-according-to-a-survey-conducted-by-slickdeals-300739582.html) than Android users. And on average, iPhone users are willing to spend [7X more](https://9to5mac.com/2023/09/06/iphone-users-spend-apps/) than Android users for apps and subscriptions. 

Because of the ease of distribution and the abundance of data, the app subscriptions market is extremely good at finding the equilibrium price such that raising or lowering price would both result in a loss of revenue. Even if the App Store and Play Store set their fees to 0%, the equilibrium price determined by the demand function and wouldnt budge. The only exceptions would be the fraction of services where theres a significant marginal cost for each subscriber. 

One thing smaller app devs (at least on iPhone) do to capture users below the equilibrium price is have hidden deals that pop up after a person declines or cancels their subscription. What many people dont realize is that anyone can access these hidden prices through the subscription history page. The normal subscription might be Premium Monthly $7.99, but there will be a Premium Monthly $3.99 option in `Apple Account  Subscriptions  [App]  See All Plans`.",2026-02-01,"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1qsv8fx/same_app_different_subscription_rates/"

these can be changed? 

When you have a saved login, that entire process is so messed up now, this huge screen appears, and whenever you re open that window it literally forces the login, instead of letting you perhaps select a different one (if the wrong one came up)

Liquid Glass is the worst thing Ive ever seen in my life. 

Is there anyway to go back?

If you select text by clicking, you can no longer drag that text to select more or less text. It just freezes. (Any app, any webpage, any window.) this seems like a legit bug that they must correct immediately 

Keyboard smaller - NO GOOD - confirmed no way to change this. 

ChatGPT answers cannot be copy and pasted selectively. When you try to press, no text gets selected. If you scroll
To top of the response, you can only *sometimes* get it to click to select text, but not always. Even if you copy, it sometimes doesnt even paste! Its ridiculous! 

Safari with no way to view tabs

Bubbles everywhere slowing things down.. pls tell me
these can be changed? 

When you have a saved login, that entire process is so messed up now, this huge screen appears, and whenever you re open that window it literally forces the login, instead of letting you perhaps select a different one (if the wrong one came up)

Click to select text works HORRIBLY now.. it seems to stutter with some bubble around it instead of allowing you to just select the damn text! What is Apple thinking? 

Liquid Glass is the worst thing Ive ever seen in my life. Ruins the experience while playing YouTube videos, makes it impossible to see somethings, regardless of opacity on Liquid Glass - there doesnt seem to be a way to change this. 

When you click  Select All on text (i.e.) that I just typed here in Reddit app, the black bar that says Cut  Copy Paste now jumps up to the top of the screen and not beside where you clicked, like it would before. 

Notes flow is different, and freezes, big checkmark in the top right corner to save now. Not good. Also bubble menus are completely atrocious and the worst thing Ive seen done by Apple.,

If I'm RCS texting using my iPhone, it would happen pretty frequently. Also noticed it happening using my Pixel texting other iPhones. I tried researching the issue, people have been having that same exact issue with no fix in sight. If you don't have unlimited SMS texting, switch to another iM service (Whatsapp, Signal or Telegram). Might get fixed whenever Apple decides to update the RCS protocol it's currently using and finally enable E2E but who knows atp.

"Most likely it's either 1) an issue with your phone connecting to your carrier's entitlement server, or 2) an issue on the entitlement server back end that is failing to authorize you for the RCS feature.

Instead of just using Google's Jibe server to verify your phone number, Apple requires the carriers to use their own  entitlement server to get the RCS server address, among other things. 

If the RCS connection goes down or has some unexpected failure,  the phone has to set everything back up, and if it can't, it will revert to SMS/MMS.

Some people attribute this to Apple's apparent malicious compliance with the EU ruling that forced them to add RCS support in the first place.  Apple has chosen to implement an older version of RCS. Whether that's true or not is anyone's guess, but one thing is for sure, RCS stability can be very wonky on iOS.

"Recent RCS changes caused carriers to change the way RCS works on iPhone so for some reason it only works over mobile data or if you have wifi calling disabled..

Turn off wifi calling and it should work, or turn off wifi auto connect and just use mobile data if you have enough. Cell signal around here is spotty so I sided with keeping wifi calling on so it wont drop a call and I just turn wifi on when apps need to update.

This is a recent thing, it just happened with iOS 26 because it handles RCS differently than iOS 18 did, the encryption is way more strict so carriers are still working on making it all work but right now you either have wifi calling, or RCS, but not both.

The camera issue is overblown. I dont take crazy pictures so I dont miss the portrait mode or ultrawide. Usually Snapchat for memories.  The speaker is a non factor.

Best phone Ive held in my hand which is a huge selling point. Although you get used to the size like any other phone, you are reminded how good this phone when you hold any other phone. 

Screen and display is top tier. Performance is amazing. Not doing any hardcore gaming on my phone so the extra core or cooling isnt a factor for me. Coming from an 15 pro max, the size is perfect and dont miss the slightly bigger screen. 

At the right price this phone is great. I snagged it recently in Canada for about $800 CAD ($600USD) on a two year plan. I think the $1000 USD is what turns people away from this phone.

"I've been enjoying my Air since launch. I made a promise to myself that I'll buy whatever iPhone eventually adds Apple Pencil support, so I can't make promises that I'll always be an Air loyalist. But if no phones ever add pencil support then I'm sticking with the Air.

I remember early on I got invited to a tourist destination. I tried briefly to take photos, but then realizing this phone isn't designed for that, so I just put it in my pocket and decided I wasn't going to take any photos. Let my friends take photos and just share the best ones. 

Ultimately, I don't think photos are that important. The ""best"" use-case I have for photos is to look back on in 10+ years and think ""oh yeah, I remember that trip. That sure was fun, right?"" Photos act as memory toggles for core memory activation. They trigger memories and that's it.

I've never cared about social media, and with the way the world is getting. I feel I should have less of my personal data on the web as possible. So I don't take photos to share with people. And with AI, if I wanted people to think I went to Paris I could just snap up a fake photo, and honestly. I'd rather have a fake photo on the internet then a real one. 

As for utility photos ""snap a photo to remember this thing,"" the Air does absolutely fine. It still has a camera. I can clip documents and signs and things I need to remember.

\------------

The speaker sucks, but it's not a big deal. I don't listen to things on the speaker. I have dedicated speaker systems at my home and at my office. I have AirPods when I'm on the go. But the rare times I use speaker phone, the speaker could be better. But if you said ""I'll give you better speakers for 100 dollars more!"" I would keep my money. 

I don't game on my phone. I don't watch media on my phone. I end most days at 70% battery life. 

===========

I would however doodle on my phone if it had pencil support. 

ALSO, one of the biggest changes is that because of how light it is, I've found myself frequently holding it with my off-hand and using my primary-hand for daily tasks. Kinda like holding it like a newspaper while I drink coffee with my primary hand. ",2026-02-08,"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1qygj8h/iphone_air_5_months_in_thoughts/"
"iPhone Air - answer to a question no-one asked.

Customer wanted a large format standard Phone - hence the Plus for many years.

Customers - and esp. businesses - wanted a value small iPhone hence the SE for many years.

"I asked and am glad I got. Portability is a major factor for me. Camera is not in my top 5 needs and neither are speakers. I am a minimalist and this phone fit exactly what I was looking for. 

Also, zero battery issues. Not once have I had to recharge during the day.
